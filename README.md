# Hospital Appointment Management System

A desktop application built with Java and JavaFX to manage 
hospital appointments digitally — replacing manual paper records.

## Built With
- Java
- JavaFX
- FXML

## Features
- Patient can register, login and book appointments
- Auto-generated queue token number per doctor
- Doctor can manage patient queue (call next, mark completed)
- Admin can add/remove doctors and view all appointments
- Live channeling number shown to patient

## OOP Concepts Used
- Inheritance — Doctor, Patient, Admin extend User
- Encapsulation — All fields private with getters
- Abstraction — Abstract User class with abstract method
- Polymorphism — displayDashboard() behaves differently per role

## How To Run
1. Open project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Make sure JavaFX SDK is configured
3. Run HospitalMain.java
